# Master's Thesis: Swapping Algorithm
This repository is for solving the symmetrical TSP with either the Euclidean distance or geodesical distance.

Instances are downloaded from TSPLIB.

- 2Opt runs the library for R "TSP"

- Christofides for a C++ Christofides implementation.

- SA contains the files for the swapping algorithm

- TSPLIB: contains the instances that we ran for my master's thesis.

- Cpp : incomplete implementation of the Swapping Algorithm for C++.
