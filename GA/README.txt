# Genetic Algorithm for TSP
## Matlab implementation

To run the instances of the genetic algorithm matrix distances were generated in geodesical distances cases. Otherwise, we simply input the coordinates file in folder TSPLIB/TSPLIB_clean/CSVs. We added each csv to matlab manually and then we ran the correr_TSPs.m file.
